"""Compute an importance matrix (imatrix) for Parler-TTS quantization.

Runs the HF reference model (fp32, CPU, greedy) over a small calibration set
and accumulates, for every nn.Linear weight, the mean squared activation per
input column — the `quant_weights` vector ggml_quantize_chunk uses to weight
per-column quantization error. Output: an .npz keyed by HF state-dict weight
name (e.g. "decoder.model.decoder.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj.weight"),
consumed by convert-parler-to-gguf.py --imatrix (which maps HF names to GGUF
tensor names itself).

The calibration texts deliberately EXCLUDE the dump-parler-reference.py
fixture prompts/descriptions, so fixture-based argmax agreement stays a
held-out metric. Numbers are written as words, matching what the engine's
prompt normalizer feeds the model.

The transformers sharded-load weight-norm repair (see dump script) is NOT
needed here: it only affects DAC/quantizer conv weights, which are never
hooked (not nn.Linear) and never quantized, and DAC runs after the decoder
so it cannot influence any hooked activation.

Usage:
  python3 compute-parler-imatrix.py --model-id parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1 \
      --out tts-cpp/models/parler-mini-v1-imatrix.npz
