// Why a GPU-requested run ended up on the CPU.
//
// The backend registry knows this at the point it gives up, but until now it
// returned a bare null and the reason survived only as a verbose-only stderr
// line. A caller that sees CPU work after asking for a GPU cannot otherwise
// tell a missing backend module apart from a device that failed to initialise,
// and those have different fixes.

    // cannot reach.
